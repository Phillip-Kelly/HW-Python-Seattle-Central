1. What is the function that creates Regex objects?

re.compile()
	

2. Why are raw strings often used when creating Regex objects?


	So that  backslashes do not have to be escaped

3. What does the search() method return?

 Match objects
	

4. How do you get the actual strings that match the pattern from a Match object?


	group() method

5. In the regex created from r'(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d)', what does group 0 cover? Group 1? Group 2?

????	

6. Parentheses and periods have specific meanings in regular expression syntax. How would you specify that you want a regex to match actual parentheses and period characters?

	use backslashes.

7. The findall() method returns a list of strings or a list of tuples of strings. What makes it return one or the other?

groups or no groups.
	

8. What does the | character signify in regular expressions?

	"either, or"

9. What two things does the ? character signify in regular expressions?

 “match zero or one of the preceding group” and nongreedy matching
	

10. What is the difference between the + and * characters in regular expressions?

matches one or more and the * matches zero or more
	

11. What is the difference between {3} and {3,5} in regular expressions?

{3} is exactly three instances and {3,5} is between 3 and five instances in regular expressions
	

12. What do the \d, \w, and \s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?

	

The \d, \w, and \s shorthand character classes match a single digit, word, or space character in regular expressions.


13. What do the \D, \W, and \S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?

The \D, \W, and \S shorthand character classes match a single character that is not a digit, word, or space character.
	

14. How do you make a regular expression case-insensitive?

 re.IGNORECASE and  re.compile()
	

15. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as the second argument to re.compile()?

The . character matches any character except the newline character. If re.DOTALL is passed as the second argument to re.compile() then
the dot will also match newline characters.
	

16. What is the difference between these two: .* and .*?

.* performs a greedy match and the .*? performs a nongreedy match.
	

17. What is the character class syntax to match all numbers and lowercase letters?

 [a-z0-9]
	

18. If numRegex = re.compile(r'\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '12 drummers, 11 pipers, five rings, 3 hens') return?

'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hens'
	

19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the second argument to re.compile() allow you to do?

This allows you to add whitespace or comments to the string passed to re.compile().



20. How would you write a regex that matches a number with commas for every three digits? It must match the following:

    '42'

    '1,234'

    '6,368,745'

but not the following:

    '12,34,567' (which has only two digits between the commas)

    '1234' (which lacks commas)

???
